# Qu - queueing language 

Qu is a non-Turing-complete programming language designed to queue objects on a reveal-js presentation slide. For example, if an user wants to display “image1” first, then the text “text1”, they can express it as the following code:

    “<1-> image1
    <2-> text1”

which, after rendering to the presentation slide, would behave as expected.

Most of the necessary theoretical knowledge for this project is from from CS302 - Theory of Computing class at Fulbright. This project provides practical experiences in language design and compiler building. My goal is to get hands-on experience at designing domain-specific languages for a specific software.


**Note**: Qu is developed as part of an internal tool, lead by a professor at Fulbright Univrsity Vietnam. As of now (January 2024), I am no longer a part of this big project. 

The original repository for this project can be found at: https://github.com/ducquando/express-server, which contains only the parser I wrote but no grammar design file. I uploaded all parts of my work to this repository to archive both the language design and the parser implementation.
